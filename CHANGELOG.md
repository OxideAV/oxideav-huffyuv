## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Round-1 8-bit decoder implemented from the clean-room workspace
  `docs/video/huffyuv/spec/00..04` + `tables/00..09`:
  - `BITMAPINFOHEADER` + extradata parse for HFYU/FFVH streams,
    including the `bpp_override` byte and v1.x low-3-bits-of-
    `biBitCount` predictor selector.
  - Per-frame decode for YUY2 / RGB24 / RGB32 with all six legal
    predictor methods (`predict_old`, `Left`, `Gradient`, `Median`,
    `LeftDecorr`, `GradientDecorr`).
  - v2.x extradata path (RLE-compressed Huffman length tables +
    longest-length-first canonical build) and v1.x precomputed-codes
    fallback (`tables/06..09`).
  - Self-roundtrip tests for `yuv-left`, `yuv-median`,
    `rgb-left`, `rgb-left-decorr`, `rgb-gradient-decorr`,
    `rgb32-left`, `rgb32-gradient-decorr` at small sizes.
  - `register_codecs(reg)` claims the FourCCs `HFYU` and `FFVH` so
    that `oxideav-avi` resolves a HuffYUV stream's `biCompression`
    straight through `CodecResolver`.

### Changed

- Clean-room rebuild from a fresh orphan `master`. The previous
  implementation was retired by the OxideAV docs audit dated
  2026-05-06; the prior history is preserved on the `old` branch.
