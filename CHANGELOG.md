# Changelog

All notable changes to this crate are documented in this file. The format
follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and
versioning follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Round-3: decoder fast-LUT + v1.x compat for all predictors:
  - `tables::HuffTable::primary_lut` — 65 536-entry primary LUT
    keyed on the top 16 bits of the bit window. Codes ≤ 16 bits hit
    a single indexed load (`(length << 8) | symbol`); codes longer
    than 16 bits route to `decode_one_slow` (per-symbol scan).
    spec/03 §3.2.2. Measured ≈ 3.2× decode speed-up on a 320×240
    YUY2 LEFT/ClassicV2 frame (16.9 ms/frame → 5.3 ms/frame).
  - 9 new v1.x-compat self-roundtrip tests covering all eight
    legal (family, method) pairs that aren't `predict_old`
    (round 2 only tested PredictOld); confirms the v1.x
    precomputed-codes set covers every residual symbol.
  - 2 LUT-coverage tests (`primary_lut_matches_per_symbol_entries`,
    `primary_lut_overflow_falls_back_to_slow_path_v1x_set_b`).

### Removed

- The round-3 in-tree `avi` module (516 LOC) was reverted: AVI
  demuxing is the responsibility of `oxideav-avi`, not the codec
  crate. `oxideav-huffyuv` should only encode/decode HuffYUV /
  FFVHuff frames given raw codec bytes; container handling lives
  one layer up. Future fixture-lockstep tests will consume frames
  from `oxideav-avi` (when wired) rather than re-implement AVI
  walking inside this crate. Same architectural principle that
  moved AVI-codec-tag resolution out of `oxideav-magicyuv` /
  `oxideav-utvideo`.

- Round-2 encoder push: full HuffYUV / FFVHuff frame encoder for the
  three 8-bit pixel families (YUY2, RGB24, RGB32) and all six legal
  predictor methods (`predict_old`, `Left`, `Gradient`, `Median`,
  `LeftDecorr`, `GradientDecorr`):
  - Three extradata paths via `ExtradataMode`:
    - `ClassicV2` (default) — embeds the matching pre-baked classic
      blob in the BIH (the proprietary's default, spec/04 §3).
    - `CustomV2` — derives per-channel histograms from the residual
      stream and runs a length-limited (max-31) package-merge
      Huffman builder, RLE-encoding the resulting length tables in
      line.
    - `V1xCompat` — emits `biSize == 0x28` with no extradata; the
      decoder reads its codebook from the v1.x precomputed-codes set.
  - `build_bitmapinfoheader` public BIH write-side helper, the
    complement to `StreamConfig::parse_bitmapinfoheader` for muxers
    that need to synthesise an AVI `strf`.
  - 22 self-roundtrip tests covering every legal (family, method)
    pair under `ClassicV2`, six (family, method) pairs under
    `CustomV2`, and three (family) v1.x-compat pairs.
  - `tables::compute_canonical_lengths` (package-merge), and
    `tables::rle_encode_one_channel` / `rle_encode_three_channels`
    public encoder utilities.

- Round-1 8-bit decoder implemented from the clean-room workspace
  `docs/video/huffyuv/spec/00..04` + `tables/00..09`:
  - `BITMAPINFOHEADER` + extradata parse for HFYU/FFVH streams,
    including the `bpp_override` byte and v1.x low-3-bits-of-
    `biBitCount` predictor selector.
  - Per-frame decode for YUY2 / RGB24 / RGB32 with all six legal
    predictor methods (`predict_old`, `Left`, `Gradient`, `Median`,
    `LeftDecorr`, `GradientDecorr`).
  - v2.x extradata path (RLE-compressed Huffman length tables +
    longest-length-first canonical build) and v1.x precomputed-codes
    fallback (`tables/06..09`).
  - Self-roundtrip tests for `yuv-left`, `yuv-median`,
    `rgb-left`, `rgb-left-decorr`, `rgb-gradient-decorr`,
    `rgb32-left`, `rgb32-gradient-decorr` at small sizes.
  - `register_codecs(reg)` claims the FourCCs `HFYU` and `FFVH` so
    that `oxideav-avi` resolves a HuffYUV stream's `biCompression`
    straight through `CodecResolver`.

### Changed

- Clean-room rebuild from a fresh orphan `master`. The previous
  implementation was retired by the OxideAV docs audit dated
  2026-05-06; the prior history is preserved on the `old` branch.
